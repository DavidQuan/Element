var someString:String = "some text";
someText += " more text"//string or text;

:Float//32 bit number
Duoble//64 bit num
someCharacter:char// single character type
:Bool// boolean teue or false

let SOME_STATIC_VARIABLE:String = "some name";// constant variable, this is also a way to enable the obj-c style: immutableNSarray and mutableNSarray and comparable classes

println("hello world");//is the log or trace in swift

var someText:String = "and";
var newText:String = "the town is light \(someText) the city is bright" //string interpolation, you can also do math: \(someVarA * someVarB)
println(newText);
